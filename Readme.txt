Note - Not to fond of the files length, but cant remember why I did it this way. I think there might have been memory issues with the micro controller.
I know I wrote my code in a very iterative fashion however, where I would implement one feature at a time and add it to a large file. But I also recall breaking up 
said file during final runs.
